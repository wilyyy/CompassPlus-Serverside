## Compass Plus Server Side Application
A PHP application that handles all CRUD for [CompassPlus](https://github.com/wilyyy/CompassPlus). This application uses an MVC (Model, View Controller) architecture to communicate with our database. This application is hosted remotely on Heroku alongside our database which is being hosted on Digital Ocean; this allows CompassPlus to be run without the use of a local host.

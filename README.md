## Compass Plus Server Side Application

**As of December 13, 2024, this API has been archived and is no longer being hosted.**

This PHP application handled all CRUD operations for [CompassPlus](https://github.com/wilyyy/CompassPlus). The application used an MVC (Model, View Controller) architecture to communicate with our database. It was hosted remotely on Heroku alongside our database, which was hosted on Digital Ocean; this allowed CompassPlus to be run remotely without the use of a local host.
